# todomvc-django

This project is made to show that you don't necessarily a JavaScript frontend framework or a ton of JavaScript to make something that has a nice one-page layout and feel to it.

This isn't to say that JavaScript doesn't have a place. However my personal opinion is that it might be overkill to make a React or Angular app for something as simple as a Todo app.

You might argue you could abstract the data model away with a Django backend served with a RESTful API and have a business specific UI on top of that. That's definitely doable and it brings the benefit that you can reuse the API with other UI types. Though I have found that most projects where a UI is needed specific API details are needed as well to make a complete experience. And thus a generic API is often not enough.
